Credit analysis Report:
The analysis evaluates the accuracy of a data model that analyzes potential borrowers and their credit.
The results: Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.
- Balanced Accuracy Score: 99.00% --> this means that when taking into account the sensitivity (recall and/or true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) of the model, the balanced prediction accuracy was 95.2%
- Precision Score: 92% --> This means 92% of predicted positives were correct
- Recall Score: 95% --> this means that the model was 95% precise in measuring true positive values our of all positive predictions made
Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.
I recommend this model because it has over 95% accuracy when predicting the outcome of if the initial loan will be repayed.
